# About #
Rally Raid is a 3D game for Windows, where you can drive like in a real rally. There are several races with several stages you can go through against the time and the opponents.

It was started as [Dakar 2012 Game](http://bmw.homelinux.org/dakar2012/), that contained only one race, but now the users can add their own races.

Current version is 1.0. Downloads are available.

There is only 2 stages ready in the Dakar 2012 race, unfortunately i have not much time to prepare further stages. But i try to create as many as possible to the start of the real Dakar. I can see now that i won't be ready on time, sorry for that!


---

### Status update - 2011.09.27 ###
Non-public beta tests has begun. Some improvements and bug fixes are added.
Public beta coming soon.

Issue tracking is opened to receive comments, some already added.

There is still lot of things to do. But the first is to add stages for the Dakar 2012.

---

### Status update - 2011.08.23 ###
Since last update when i thought i was ready, i wasn't :)
So i did a lot of things. I have started to play with the game, and not only in editor mode. I hope soon i can release a playable version with a stage.

**Done:**
  * base AI, and a improvement (failures)
  * working gameplay
  * working save/load game

**To do:**
  * improved AI
  * improved collision detection to give the right penalty
  * use the editor to create stages

---

### Status update - 2011.07.07 ###
The good news is that almost everything i planned is ready. Maybe one or more things need to be improved (see the todo list), but basic functionality should work and now i can start to create the stages.

**Done:**
  * road handling
  * editor
  * AI
  * gameplay
  * menu

**To do:**
  * the asphalt roads does not have physics as in Dakar 2011
  * improved AI

**Details:**

**Road physics**

I was able to add physics to the roads, but the hkpExtendedMeshShape in Havok is really slow. Newton Game Dynamics is much more faster in this cases (unfortunately it doesn't have a normal vehicle support). An idea is welcome for the road physics improvement.
