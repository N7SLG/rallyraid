# Description #

If you select an object form the list the action will automatically change to _add object stage_ in the [action table](EditorMainS#Action_Table.md), so you can click on action to place some object on the stage that you selected.

## Scale ##
Object scale. You can scale the object with this parameter. Use this parameter carefully, because only the visible object will be scaled by this factor, but not this physical.

## Rotate ##
Object rotation around the _Y_ coordinate in degrees.

## Object Texture Preview ##
If you select an object you can see its texture(s) in the preview.

## Object Type List ##
The available objects that you can use in a stage. And you can see some prameters of the object:
  * name
  * [category](Terminology#Object.md)
  * [num (dense information)](Terminology#Object.md)
  * the number of the objects of a type that are currently in use (visible)
  * how many object found in the object cache (maybe visible, maybe not)
